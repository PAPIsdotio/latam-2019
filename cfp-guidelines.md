# Call for Proposals — PAPIs Latam 2019

PAPIs is the 1st series of international conferences dedicated to **real-world Machine Learning applications, techniques, and tools**. Previous editions took place in Boston, Sydney, Barcelona, Paris, Valencia, London, and PAPIs Latam will be held in São Paulo for the 3rd time! It will bring together engineers, scientists, researchers, hackers and managers who will meet to share experiences and discover the latest innovations, techniques, and tools to build ML applications. Find out more at [papis.io/latam-2019](http://www.papis.io/latam-2019).

## Key dates

* **June 25-26**: Conference takes place in São Paulo

We'd like to **strongly encourage women to submit proposals**. As a community conference, we think it's important to increase diversity in AI. Applications for funding to reimburse childcare and travel costs will be invited from women and primary carers whose proposals are accepted. We're also looking for [sponsors](https://www.papis.io/sponsoring) to support our diversity efforts!

## Tracks

### Engineering — June 25

* Audience: developers, ML engineers, and ScienceOps professionals (DevOps for Data Science)
* Format: 20' (+ 5' for Q&A)
* Topics: Discussions on the technical challenges of deploying ML systems in production, and lessons learnt from experience. We invite industry participants to describe their war stories and the architectures, pipelines, frameworks, APIs, etc., that they built to create or improve intelligent applications. Proposals for this track should be technical. They can range from ML beginner-friendly how-tos to deep dives for more experienced professionals. We encourage speakers to show code!

### ML in the Wild — June 25

* Audience: everyone who's interested in the integration of ML into real-world applications
* Format: 20' (+ 5' for Q&A)
* Topics: Presentations of ML use cases in new areas, discussions on the challenges of integrating ML into various applications/products, and lessons learnt. This can include domain-specific challenges, as well as those related to product design, transparency, privacy, fairness, accountability, ethics, etc. We would like to also encourage the community to share their failure stories — after all, you aren’t a real ML innovator until you’ve had to deal with massive failure of your ML system! 

### New techniques — June 26

* Audience: experienced practitioners who have an advanced knowledge of ML
* Format: 20' (+ 5' for Q&A)
* Topics: Innovations, applied research, and new ML techniques that have the potential to take the industry further. Proposals for this track will be evaluated on the basis of their novelty. They should also be technical. We encourage speakers to show code!

### Tools — June 26

* Audience: developers, engineers, scientists, technical managers
* Format: 10' demo OR 30' tutorial (+ 5' for Q&A) — **no slides allowed**
* Topics: Tools and APIs that make it easier to experiment with ML, integrate it into real-world products/applications, or to deploy it at scale. We particularly welcome tools which are open source, or freely accessible. We will also select demos of proprietary tools as long as the presentations are not commercial, they are engaging, practical, or teach how to do a specific task with the tool being demonstrated.

## What we're looking for

### Presentations

We're looking for practical and focused presentations, on a wide range of experience and technicality levels. We’re looking for a diverse and creative line-up of speakers, preferably with experience in public speaking. Proposals will be blind-reviewed by our Program Committee and evaluated on the basis of their significance and/or clarity of presentation. **Please make sure to also consult our [tips & rules](https://github.com/PAPIsdotio/general/blob/master/cfp-tips-rules.md) for advice on how to craft a good proposal and submit it.**

_Presentations should be non-commercial. A very limited number of sponsored speaking slots are also available — please contact the [sponsorship team](mailto:sponsoring@papis.io) for more information._

### Papers

We welcome technical papers, industrial experience reports, primers, perspective papers, essays, review papers, and research papers from authors of accepted proposals. While submitting an article for peer-review is no requirement to be accepted to present at PAPIs, we highly encourage authors to take the time to share their work with the community in this format as well. Articles will appear on [Authorea](https://authorea.com/) as web-based pre-prints, and they will be published in the Proceedings of Machine Learning Research journal (see our [2017](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v82/), [2016](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v67/) and [2015](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v50/) proceedings). More information is available in our [tips & rules](https://github.com/PAPIsdotio/general/blob/master/cfp-tips-rules.md).
