PAPIs is the 1st series of international conferences dedicated to **real-world Machine Learning applications, techniques, and tools**, and it is Calling for Proposals.

Previous editions took place in Boston, Sydney, Barcelona, Paris, Valencia, London, and PAPIs Latam will be held in São Paulo for the 3rd time! It will bring together engineers, scientists, researchers, hackers and managers who will meet to share experiences and discover the latest innovations, techniques, and tools to build ML applications. Find out more at [papis.io/latam-2019](http://www.papis.io/latam-2019).

## Tracks

### New techniques — June 26

* Audience: experienced practitioners who have an advanced knowledge of ML
* Format: 20' presentation (+ 5' for Q&A)
* Topics: Innovations, applied research, and new ML techniques that have the potential to take the industry further. Proposals for this track will be evaluated on the basis of their novelty. They should also be technical. We encourage speakers to show code!

### Engineering — June 25

* Audience: developers, ML engineers, and ScienceOps professionals (DevOps for Data Science)
* Format: 20' presentation (+ 5' for Q&A)
* Topics: Discussions on the technical challenges of deploying ML systems in production, and lessons learnt from experience. We invite industry participants to describe their war stories and the architectures, pipelines, frameworks, APIs, etc., that they built to create or improve intelligent applications. Proposals for this track should be technical. They can range from ML beginner-friendly how-tos to deep dives for more experienced professionals. We encourage speakers to show code!

### Tools — June 26

* Audience: developers, engineers, scientists, technical managers
* Format: 10' demo OR 30' tutorial (+ 5' for Q&A) — **no slides or videos allowed**
* Topics: Tools and APIs that make it easier to experiment with ML, integrate it into real-world products/applications, or to deploy it at scale. We particularly welcome tools which are open source, or freely accessible. We will also select demos of proprietary tools as long as the presentations are not commercial, they are engaging, practical, or teach how to do a specific task with the tool being demonstrated.

### ML in the Wild — June 25

* Audience: everyone who's interested in the integration of ML into real-world applications
* Format: 20' presentation (+ 5' for Q&A)
* Topics: Presentations of ML use cases in new areas, discussions on the challenges of integrating ML into various applications/products, and lessons learnt. This can include domain-specific challenges, as well as those related to product design, transparency, privacy, fairness, accountability, ethics, etc. We would like to also encourage the community to share their failure stories — after all, you aren’t a real ML innovator until you’ve had to deal with massive failure of your ML system!

## What we're looking for

We're looking for **practical and focused presentations**, on a wide range of experience and technicality levels. We’re looking for a diverse and creative line-up of speakers, preferably with experience in public speaking. Proposals will be blind-reviewed by our Program Committee and evaluated on the basis of their significance and/or clarity of presentation.

We'd like to **strongly encourage women to submit proposals**. As a community conference, we think it's important to increase diversity in ML. Applications for funding to reimburse childcare and travel costs will be invited from women and primary carers whose proposals are accepted. We're also looking for sponsors to support our diversity efforts!

Presentations should be **non-commercial**. A very limited number of sponsored speaking slots are also available — please contact the [sponsorship team](mailto:sponsoring@papis.io) for more information.

**⚠️ Please follow our [tips & rules](https://github.com/PAPIsdotio/general/blob/master/cfp-tips-rules.md) for advice on how to craft a good proposal and submit it.**
